CCN on-demand routing protocol

POFClient.py is a CODV on demand routing protocol. A client is a switch or a router.

POFServer.py is a CODV on demand routing protocol for a video server. A server is a switch or router with content already cached.

POFClient.py and POFServer.py has been tested in planetlab. The  testing topo is written in topo.txt.

Source codes in CoDVinNs2 are simulation codes in ns2. You can test the on demand routing protocol by downloading these files. Replace the according files in /ns2/ns-allinone-2.35/ns-2.35/aodv. Then make. Still use the name of AODV to test routing, and the acturl routing protocol running is a CCN on demand routing protocol now.

Thanks for your attention.
